FundiMzii: A Web-Based Application for Recording
and Tracing Client Measurements for Tailors
1. Title of the Project
FundiMzii: A Web-Based Application for Recording and Tracing
Client Measurements for Tailors
2. Brief Overview of the Research Topic
The tailoring industry in Kenya is largely informal and dominated by small-scale fundis operating
in markets and residential areas. Existing mobile applications on Google Play Store such as
Tailor Mate, CloudTailor, and Darzee offer measurement and order management features.
However, preliminary field observations and interviews with over 35 professional tailors at
Kariobangi North Market reveal that these applications have complex user interfaces, require
constant internet connectivity, involve recurring subscription fees, and use workflows and
terminologies that do not match local tailoring practices. Consequently, the majority of Kenyan
tailors continue to rely on traditional exercise books and notebooks, which are prone to loss,
damage, illegibility, and inefficiency.
3. Brief Statement of the Research Problem
Small-scale tailors in Kariobangi North Market and similar informal settings lack a simple,
affordable, offline-capable digital tool designed specifically for the Kenyan context to capture,
store, search, and retrieve client measurements and order history. The continued dependence
on manual record-keeping using books leads to frequent measurement errors, misplaced or lost
client records, delayed order fulfillment, and inability to efficiently serve returning clients for
alterations, ultimately reducing service quality and business growth.
4. Explanation of Why This Research Question is Important and Why the Project is Worth
Pursuing
This project addresses a practical, everyday challenge faced by thousands of fundis who form a
critical part of Kenya’s informal economy and the local fashion value chain. A simple,
locally-relevant digital solution has the potential to reduce measurement errors by more than
80%, increase customer satisfaction, enable tailors to handle more clients, and improve their
income without adding operational costs. The research will be conducted among more than 35
professional tailors at Kariobangi North Market, providing real user feedback and ensuring the
solution is grounded in actual needs. The project perfectly aligns with TUK’s emphasis on
solving local problems using ICT, demonstrates practical skills in web development, database
design, and user-centered design, and produces a deployable system that can later be
extended into a mobile application in Project B. It also serves as a strong portfolio piece
showcasing technology design for low-digital-literacy users in the informal sector — a highly
sought-after skill in the Kenyan job market and among organizations promoting digital inclusion.
5. Proposed Solution to the Research Problem in the Form of a System
FundiMzii will be developed as a responsive web application that works seamlessly on low-cost
smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The prototype will be developed and tested
locally using XAMPP server with MySQL as the database management system.
Core features of the proposed system:
- Simple one-page client registration and measurement entry form (bilingual: English/Swahili)
- Offline data capture with automatic synchronization when internet is available
- Instant search functionality by client name, phone number, or date
- Ability to attach reference photos of styles or finished garments
- Generation and export of measurement sheets as PDF (for printing or WhatsApp sharing)
- Basic reports showing total clients, pending orders, and frequently requested measurements
- Extremely minimal and touch-friendly user interface that a tailor can learn in under 10 minutes
Technologies to be used:
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP (CodeIgniter or Laravel framework)
- Database: MySQL
- Local development and testing: XAMPP server
